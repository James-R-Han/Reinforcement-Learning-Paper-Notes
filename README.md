# Reinforcement-Learning-Paper-Notes

Welcome to my RL learning journey. These notes serve 3 purposes.
- Refresh your memory of the material if you've previously read it.
- Exposure to the main ideas to prime a new reader.
- Provide personal accountability for myself to take high quality notes.

The first section that I'm currently working on is a list of key papers by "https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html".

You should have some basic ML/DL and basic RL knowledge to understand these papers. For RL knowledge, the Sutton and Barto textbook is a quintessential starting point (https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf). 

How to interpret my papers' notes.

- On the left hand side margin, I write down the key points/summary of the paragraph which correspond to the highlights in orange. This makes it easy to skim through the organization of a paper.
- On the right hand side margin, I write down more specific details which correspond to the highlights in yellow.
- If there is no highlights in a paragraph, there will still be a summary. 
- If there are pink highlights, these are key points to the paper's specific algorithm/method.
- Notes in green are just my own notes on the material.

Let's build a future with RL :)
