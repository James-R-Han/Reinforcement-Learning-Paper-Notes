# Reinforcement-Learning-Paper-Notes

Welcome to my RL learning journey. These notes serve me 3 purposes:
- Refresh my memory of previously read material.
- A catalog/library of the RL papers I've read (I do love my kindle library).
- Taking notes/summary without directly quoting the paper forces me to understand it.

Potential use to you?
- Refresh your memory of the material.
- Exposure to the main ideas to prime a new reader.

The first section that I'm currently working on is a list of key papers by "https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html".
- I've previously read a few of these, but I wanted to review them and take more proper notes moving forward.
- I plan to later expand this to papers in my thesis literature review on RL crowd navigation.

How I take paper notes for essay format:
- On the left-hand side margin, I write down the key points/summary which correspond to the highlights in orange. This makes it easy to skim through the organization of a paper or to find a particular section.
- On the right-hand side margin, I write down more specific details which correspond to the highlights in yellow.
- Sometimes there will be no highlights. The summary will be a description of what is in the paragraph. 
- The pink highlights are points specific to the paper's algorithm/method.
- Notes in green are just my own notes on the material.

How I take paper notes for traditional paper format.
- Notes with "-" is the same as left hand side margin.
- Notes with "." is the same as right hand side margin.
- Rest is the same.
